## Inspiration
The inspiration for the Big Brother project was the noticeable decrease of attention span within today's society. Many consumers in today's society do not post feedback and lose interest very quickly. Therefore, to keep consumers happy and have reliable feedback, Big Brother will always be watching to ensure a happy lifestyle.
## What it does
Big Brother uses computer vision to track the gaze direction of any individual to know where they are looking.  Additionally, it uses machine learning to determine what emotion they're feeling at any moment and charts those feelings on graphs. 
## How we built it
We used python opencv to track the emotions and gazes and then put that information into a graph on tkinter creating a user-friendly software to easily keep track of attention and emotion. We also used React to create a visually appealing website for people to easily download this tool.
## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were running multiple processes at once, embedding graphs into the GUI, and scaling the images to fit the screen. We were able to overcome these challenges by working as a group to tackle them and effectively stream new data into the graph at the same time as storing that new data. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of learning how to combine different processes together to create a functioning program as well as furthering our knowledge of Python and web development skills. We are also proud of being able to track emotions live and show the results instantaneously using new computer vision skills.
## What we learned
Through this project we learned new techniques for python software development as well as
React web development. We learned new tools on how to make a GUI that is both functional and nice to look at. We also learned how to efficiently use subprocess to stream data through a folder into the main process.
## What's next for Big Brother
Big Brother has a wide variety of uses which can be studied and marketed towards. Ads that are able to ensure the watchers are paying attention and enjoying their ads are much more powerful than others. Companies that keep track of what customers pay attention to and how they react can greatly improve their marketing strategy. The future is now and **Big Brother is always watching**
